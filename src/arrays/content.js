      `Googling is a skill. Not many people can manipulate query correctly when searching for the solution they needed. Googling when some issues occur does not translate to lack of skills.
      Even in the presence of AIs now, some oddly-specific problems require you to google the right thing into the search bar and actually look for the answers accross multiple websites.`,

      `There is a lot of upsides and downsides when it comes to AI, but it is a very interesting topic. 
      The use of AI in a professional environment is not a must, but it can boost your productivity and even your knowledge. 
      I, too, use AI in my works, although not everyday, but it is always a pleasant feeling every time you know 
      that there is some new method you can do to achieve your project goals given by AI, a feeling of enlightenment. 
      But, continuously using AI without taking notes of it can be bad too! 
      Every time I encounter a problem while coding and had to use AI, it is almost always guaranteed that the code will be confusing. 
      This is due to the knowledge you are given is not perceived well at first by your understanding, 
      so you have to give yourself time to learn what the AI gives you, and also look more into it to see whether or not 
      the solution it gives you is the right approach (or even right at all).`,
